Description:
    This package provides a function for calculating the required number of 
    subjects per group to achieve a specified power for a 
    Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. Users may also calculate
    post-hoc power of a test, given parameters of the experiment.
    There are also several helper functions for interconverting probability,
    odds, relative risk, and odds ratio values.
